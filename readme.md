## Things to do before committing

1. Create an issue explaining your work in GitHub if there is no related issue.
2. Create a branch with the format of [name]_[issue number], e.g. david_1.
3. Compare the changed files with the original files.
4. Proofread the commit message.
5. Check if you are on the right branch.
