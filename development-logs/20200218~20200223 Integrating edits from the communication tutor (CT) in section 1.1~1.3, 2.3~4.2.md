# 20200218~20200223 Integrating edits from the communication tutor (CT) in section 1.1~1.3, 2.3~4.2

## Notes

To build two-way trust between domestic helpers and employers, the CT suggested that employers should also provide their information (as a part of their job description) and that helpers should be able to provide feedback to their employers. As a result, helpers can search for employers' information. I decided to accept this advice.
