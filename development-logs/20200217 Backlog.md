## Suggestions

- Leave your name after the task name above like "... (David)" to indicate that you are working on it.
- Work on one task at a time.
- Try not to work on the same task the other person is working on to avoid conflicts.

By the way, for Git branching, do something like this:\

, but not this:\

<img width="211" alt="git-branching-04" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43230869/72802063-e051de00-3c85-11ea-8580-f6a206bc1399.png">
