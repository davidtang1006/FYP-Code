## 1.2. Objectives

This project aims at building a platform to connect employers and domestic helpers.
The following are the main focuses of our project:
1. To develop a friendly user interface for our application.
2. To build a secure, tamper-proof data storage.
3. To provide a sufficient and convenient query service for users to access the data.

To achieve the first objective, existing platforms which provide databases for the job seekers (including domestic helpers) and employers were studied.
Some of their approaches to the user interface was adapted to our system.

To achieve the second objective, blockchain is implemented as the storage layer.
Most of the data will be saved in this layer with verification to ensure they will not be deliberately changed or deleted.
Only permitted users are allowed to access the data to protect their privacy.

To achieve the third objective, database technology is used to provide basic operations.
Meanwhile, some other queries may also be designed according to the demands of the users.

The biggest challenge in our project is the whole design.
The combination of blockchain and database technology is seldom applied in living things.
Non-living things, such as insurance and cryptocurrencies, are now started to be implemented with blockchain [1].
However, our project is much more complicated.
Some users may desire to delete or update their data, but with the feature of blockchain, it is impossible to change the uploaded data to prevent tampering.
Therefore, we have to strike a balance between the practical demands of users and the secure characteristic of blockchain.

<!-- A system to cope with the requirement will be composed of:
- Front end (this part implements a user-friendly interface for the end users, including employers and domestic helpers)
- Back end (which includes administration of database, implementation of blockchain, etc.) (?)

A serious challenge of this project is that it touches real-world problems.
The project should take the complexity of a person into consideration.
How should contracts be handled?
What should be our privacy policy?
With limited time to develop the system, it may not be in full compliance with the law.
We should be prepared to make adjustments to better comply with the law. -->
