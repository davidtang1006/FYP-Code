## 1.2. Objectives

This project aims at building a platform to connect employers and domestic helpers.
The following are the main focuses of our project:
1. To develop a friendly user interface (UI) for our application.
2. To build a secure, tamper-proof data storage.
3. To provide a sufficient and convenient query service for users to access the data.

To achieve the first objective, existing platforms which provide databases for the job seekers (including domestic helpers) and employers were studied.
Some of their approaches to the UI was adapted to our system.

To achieve the second objective, we adopted blockchain to store persistent data.
With blockchain, malicious or untraceable modifications and deletions of data are prevented.
Additionally, we may implement a verification system before data entering the blockchain to ensure that the data are genuine.
We also ensured that only authenticated users who have finished registering are allowed to access their data to guarantee storage security.

To achieve the third objective, we allowed users to specify several query constraints that meet most of the need.
The specification is through appropriate UI components that maximize convenience.

One of the challenges in our project is understanding others' work.
It is surely not practical to start from nothing and build every part on our own, so we need to study work from others and try to integrate their work into our system.
The concept of blockchain has thrived for years, and there are plenty of applications developed around it [1].
Also, there are abundant open-source projects that achieved goals similar to ours to study.
However, understanding others' work, especially the inner workings, is not an easy task.
It takes careful reading of others' documentation.
Lengthy standards are sometimes involved.
It can be an endless pursuit.
Looking into examples given can be one solution to this situation.

Another challenge of this project is that it touches real-world aspects.
The project should take the complexity of a person into consideration.
We needed to consider problems such as "how should contracts be handled", "what should be our privacy policy".
With limited time to develop the system, it may not be in full compliance with the law.
We should be prepared to make adjustments to better comply with the law.
