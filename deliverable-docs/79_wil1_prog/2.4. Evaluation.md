## 2.4. Evaluation

Our major purpose of developing our application is to build trust between domestic helpers and employers.
Under this purpose, we aimed to build a secure blockchain database with a sufficient, convenient query service and a friendly user interface.
We have several questions that can help us to evaluate our project with respect to the objectives we set:
1. Are there enough measures taken to prevent breaches of security such as unauthorized access?
2. Is the blockchain database implemented legitimately such that core features of blockchain (i.e. decentralization, transparency and immutability) are not compromised?
3. Are the query options sufficient? How do they compare to the existing platforms?
4. Is the user interface intuitive such that users will not miss any important functions or messages?
5. Is our application convincing enough such that users will trust our platform and that helpers and employers will be able to trust each other?
