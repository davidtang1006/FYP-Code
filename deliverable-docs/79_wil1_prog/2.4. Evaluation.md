## 2.4. Evaluation

One of our purposes of developing the system is to build trust between domestic helpers and employers.
However, it will probably require a long period of time in practice to observe and improve, because the number of users may grow as time goes by.
Therefore, here are some quantitative indicators that will help us to evaluate the effectiveness:
1. Does the application attract helpers and employers with its service as well as by showing the desired searching results?
2. Is the maximum capacity of the system satisfactory during peak hours? How does any delay in the process influence the system?
3. Is the system easy to deploy by companies? If not, which parts in the frontend, backend or database are the bottlenecks?
4. Is there any risk of data leaks? Would our application gain trust from domestic helpers looking for stable jobs? Would it gain the trust of employers looking for suitable helpers?
5. What is the feedback from old customers or business insiders in current domestic helper agencies?

On the aspect of commercialization, our project is more than development, but also data analysis, marketing and a contribution to society.
These focus points will be our first steps to promote our application to the world.
