## 1.3. Literature Survey

### 1.3.1. Blockchain basics

Blockchain is a concept extracted from the well-known Bitcoin system [2 (1.2)] after it has been proved to be successful for recording payment records.
Blockchain is considered to have the following core features: decentralization, transparency and immutability [1].
There is no central authority to control blockchain.
It is controlled collectively by the peers in the blockchain network.
Communication is via a peer-to-peer system instead of a client-server system.
Thus, a blockchain system is decentralized.
When a user would like to add a transaction to the blockchain, the user should broadcast the transaction to the network.
The transactions are transparent to at least the blockchain peers.
Thus, a blockchain system is considered to be transparent.
Once a transaction is recorded on a blockchain, it is almost impossible to erase it.
If one wants to erase the transaction or to tamper with transactions in any way, one needs to convince the blockchain network that the tampered version of blockchain is the right one, which is extremely difficult.
Therefore, blockchain can be regarded as a write-only structure.

![Figure 1.3.1: Blockchain Structure](./79_wil1_prog-resources/01_blockchain-structure.png)

The structure of blockchain in the Bitcoin white paper [2 (1.2)] is summarized in Figure 1.3.1.
Transactions are encapsulated in blocks, which are then chained in a list.
New blocks are generated through proof-of-work.
The blockchain peers solve a cryptographic hashing problem, where the problem is adjusted to the difficulty such that the expected time to generate a new block is 10 minutes.
Suppose the attacker is $z$ blocks behind the longest chain (the chain everyone agrees on), the probability that the attacker finds the next block is $p$ and the probability the regular blockchain peers finds the next block is $q$, it can be shown that the probability the attacker surpasses regular blockchain peers is $1 - \sum_{k=0}^{z+1} \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!} \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{q}{p} \right)^{z+1-k} \right)$, where $\lambda = z \frac{q}{p}$ [2].
Normally, with $p \gg q$ and $z$ large enough, it is virtually impossible that the attacker catches up and surpasses regular blockchain peers.

![Figure 1.3.2: Transaction Structure](./79_wil1_prog-resources/01_transaction-structure.png)

The transactions can be arranged as another chain as in Figure 1.3.2, which represents the history of coin ownership.
The transactions represent a payment from owner 3 to owner 4, then from owner 4 to owner 5.
If B wants to fabricate a record "A transferred a coin to me", B needs A to digitally sign, (the hash of the previous transaction + the public key of the next owner (B)).
This is not possible since B does not have A's private key.

![Figure 1.3.3: Transaction Inputs and Outputs](./79_wil1_prog-resources/01_transaction-io.png)

To enable divisible coins, a transaction may consist of several inputs and outputs as shown in Figure 1.3.3.
Therefore, a payment value can come from multiple inputs and it can be split into multiple outputs.

One major criticism of the proof-of-work scheme is on its serious energy and resource consuming.
Currently, Bitcoin has an annual carbon footprint of about 34.75 Mt CO2 and consumes about 73.17 TWh of electricity.
The statistics are similar to those of medium-sized countries in Europe [3].
The energy and resources could have been spent on more useful usage.
Another major criticism is that the blockchain as in Bitcoin does not scale.
For Bitcoin, it can only handle around 7 transactions per second.
In comparison, VISA handles normally 7000 transactions per second [4], with the carbon footprint per transaction being several orders of magnitude less [3].

### 1.3.3. Existing business models

The business model of our project is enlightened by existing models including those in local domestic helper agencies, online direct hiring platforms, and blockchain-based platforms in other industries.

#### Local domestic helper agencies

The vast majority of employers prefer to find agencies when they need a domestic helper.
Generally, agencies like Smart Living [5] and Lotus Employment Agency [6] provide assistance to select helpers and complete required documents with lots of experience, which saves employers' ample time and effort.
Beyond the convenience of agencies' support, however, the costly agency service sometimes overcharges both employers and domestic helpers so as to gain greater profit.
In addition to boosting the limited domestic helper market in one agency, some agencies even arrange helpers with superficial information to employers.

<!-- Pros: save ample time and effort (experienced, helpers' selection and paperwork)

Cons: costly, less candidates, superficial informations, illegal agency placement fees (overcharging helpers, confiscating passports)

Example:
- Arrow Employment Services, Fair Employment Agency, Royal Maids
- Interactive Employer Service of the Labour Department [1], 
- Smart Living [2], 
- HelperGo [3], 
- Lotus Employment Agency [4], 
- MamaHelpers [5]

#### Online direct hiring platforms

Directly hiring domestic helpers is also available in Hong Kong, usually through online platforms like MamaHelpers [7] and HelperPlace [8].
Boundless choices of domestic helpers can be found not limited to one agency.
And the financial cost of employment is reduced by eliminating the agency commission.
Nonetheless, it is time-consuming to go through all the paperwork and procedures.

<!-- Pros: immense freedom of choices, lower cost

Cons: time-consuming(~1st pros)

Example: MamaHelper, HelperPlace -->

#### Blockchain-based platforms in other industries

Although not focused on domestic helpers, there are blockchain-based platforms built for other industries, such as Guardtime's wine authentication [9] and RMIT's land management systems [10].
Such platforms utilised blockchain's advantage to prevent superficial information since all data appended to blockchain are traceable.
Further applications on blockchain come from Estonia where most public services have built with a secure digital infrastructure [11].
However, the high cost of verification slows down the extensile uses of blockchain technology.

<!-- Pros: anti-tamper

Cons: high cost to verify
