## 1.3. Literature Survey

Our project is enlightened by local domestic helper agencies, online direct hiring platforms, and by blockchain-based platforms in other industries.

### 1.3.1. Local domestic helper agencies

The vast majority of employers prefer to find agencies when they need a domestic helper.
Generally, agencies like Smart Living [1] and Lotus Employment Agency [2] provide assistance to select helpers and complete required documents with lots of experience, which saves employers' ample time and effort.
Beyond the convenience of agencies' support, however, the costly agency service sometimes overcharges both employers and domestic helpers so as to gain greater profit.
In addition to boosting the limited domestic helper market in one agency, some agencies even arrange helpers with superficial information to employers.

<!-- Pros: save ample time and effort (experienced, helpers' selection and paperwork)

Cons: costly, less candidates, superficial informations, illegal agency placement fees (overcharging helpers, confiscating passports)

Example:
- Arrow Employment Services, Fair Employment Agency, Royal Maids
- Interactive Employer Service of the Labour Department [1], 
- Smart Living [2], 
- HelperGo [3], 
- Lotus Employment Agency [4], 
- MamaHelpers [5]

### 1.3.2. Online direct hiring platforms

Directly hiring domestic helpers is also available in Hong Kong, usually through online platforms like MamaHelpers [3] and HelperPlace [4].
Boundless choices of domestic helpers can be found not limited to one agency.
And the financial cost of employment is reduced by eliminating the agency commission.
Nonetheless, it is time-consuming to go through all the paperwork and procedures.

<!-- Pros: immense freedom of choices, lower cost

Cons: time-consuming(~1st pros)

### 1.3.3. Blockchain-based platforms in other industries

Although not focused on domestic helpers, there are blockchain-based platforms built for other industries, such as Guardtime's wine authentication [5] and RMIT's land management systems [6].
Such platforms utilised blockchain's advantage to prevent superficial information since all data appended to blockchain are traceable.
Further applications on blockchain come from Estonia where most public services have built with a secure digital infrastructure [7].
However, the high cost of verification slows down the extensile uses of blockchain technology.

<!-- Pros: anti-tamper

Cons: high cost to verify
