## 1.3. Literature Survey

### 1.3.1. Blockchain basics

Blockchain is a concept extracted from the well-known Bitcoin system [1] after it has been proved to be successful for recording payment records.
Blockchain is considered to have the following core features: decentralization, transparency and immutability [2].
There is no central authority to control blockchain.
It is controlled collectively by the peers in the blockchain network.
Communication is via a peer-to-peer system instead of a client-server system.
Thus, a blockchain system is decentralized.
When a user would like to add a transaction to the blockchain, the user should broadcast the transaction to the network.
The transactions are transparent to at least the blockchain peers.
Thus, a blockchain system is considered to be transparent.
Once a transaction is recorded on a blockchain, it is almost impossible to erase it.
If one wants to erase the transaction or to tamper with transactions in any way, one needs to convince the blockchain network that the tampered version of blockchain is the right one, which is extremely difficult.
Therefore, blockchain can be regarded as a write-only structure.

![Figure 1.3.1: Blockchain Structure](./79_wil1_prog-resources/01_blockchain-structure.png)

The structure of blockchain in the Bitcoin white paper [1] is summarized in Figure 1.3.1.
Transactions are encapsulated in blocks, which are then chained in a list.
New blocks are generated through proof-of-work.
The blockchain peers solve a cryptographic hashing problem, where the problem is adjusted to the difficulty such that the expected time to generate a new block is 10 minutes.
Suppose the attacker is $z$ blocks behind the longest chain (the chain everyone agrees on), the probability that the attacker finds the next block is $p$ and the probability the regular blockchain peers finds the next block is $q$, it can be shown that the probability the attacker surpasses regular blockchain peers is $1 - \sum_{k=0}^{z+1} \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!} \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{q}{p} \right)^{z+1-k} \right)$, where $\lambda = z \frac{q}{p}$ [3].
Normally, with $p \gg q$ and $z$ large enough, it is virtually impossible that the attacker catches up and surpasses regular blockchain peers.

![Figure 1.3.2: Transaction Structure](./79_wil1_prog-resources/01_transaction-structure.png)

The transactions can be arranged as another chain as in Figure 1.3.2, which represents the history of coin ownership.
The transactions represent a payment from owner 3 to owner 4, then from owner 4 to owner 5.
If B wants to fabricate a record "A transferred a coin to me", B needs A to digitally sign, (the hash of the previous transaction + the public key of the next owner (B)).
This is not possible since B does not have A's private key.

![Figure 1.3.3: Transaction Inputs and Outputs](./79_wil1_prog-resources/01_transaction-io.png)

To enable divisible coins, a transaction may consist of several inputs and outputs as shown in Figure 1.3.3.
Therefore, a payment value can come from multiple inputs and it can be split into multiple outputs.

One major criticism of the proof-of-work scheme is on its serious energy and resource consuming.
Currently, Bitcoin has an annual carbon footprint of about 34.75 Mt CO2 and consumes about 73.17 TWh of electricity.
The statistics are similar to those of medium-sized countries in Europe [4].
The energy and resources could have been spent on more useful usage.
Another major criticism is that the blockchain as in Bitcoin does not scale.
For Bitcoin, it can only handle around 7 transactions per second.
In comparison, VISA handles normally 7,000 transactions per second [5], with the carbon footprint per transaction being several orders of magnitude less [4].

### 1.3.2. Blockchain for data sharing

### 1.3.3. Existing business models

The business model of our project is inspired by existing models including those in local domestic helper agencies, online direct hiring platforms, and blockchain-based platforms in other industries.

#### Local domestic helper agencies

Some employers would seek assistance from agencies to hire domestic helpers.
Examples of such agencies include Arrow Employment Services [6], Fair Employment Agency [7], Lotus Employment Agency [8] and Overseas Employment Centre [9].
Arrow Employment Services and Fair Employment Agency offer services for hiring both local and foreign domestic helpers, while Lotus Employment Agency and Overseas Employment Centre focus on services for hiring foreign domestic helpers.
Those agencies have years of experience.
For instance, Overseas Employment Centre was established in 1976 and has experience of nearly half a century.
With such experience, they can help employers with finding and interviewing domestic helpers, and completing essential documents in a convenient manner.
Employers can as well as consult those agencies for professional suggestions.
Normally, without agencies, employers, especially the inexperienced ones have to go through lengthy, yet essential forms or guidance notes from the Hong Kong Immigration Department [10] on their own.
With agencies, their time and effort are saved.
The risk of employers inadvertently breaching regulations is also lowered.
Besides, agencies offer additional services, which is ideal for an employer looking for a one-stop service.
For instance, Overseas Employment Centre has dedicated training centres for foreign helpers in their home countries.
The centre also has an organisation "Smile Club" for Indonesian helpers which organizes activities for their welfare.
Agencies can provide follow-up services as well, like translation service that reduces language barriers between employers and foreign helpers.

| Agency Name                | Price for hiring a foreign helper | Price for hiring a local helper |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Arrow Employment Services  | $9,800                            | $6,500                          |
| Fair Employment Agency     | $9,900                            | $5,000                          |
| Lotus Employment Agency    | $9,403 up                         | -                               |
| Overseas Employment Centre | $7,980 up                         | -                               |
Table 1.3.1: Prices for Typical Service Packages

One downside of involving an agency is that it introduces extra costs for employers and helpers.
Table 1.3.1 shows the prices for typical service packages for some agencies as listed in their official websites.
Also, agencies are criticized for charging helpers placement fees [11].
And as it is previously discussed, it is not guaranteed that the helper profiles provided by agencies are accurate.
There is no incentives for agencies to provide less than satisfactory information to employers.
From the helper profiles given by agencies' websites, it is observed that only positive information is listed.
There is a chance that helper profiles are enhanced by agencies to attract employers.
However, if blockchain is used for storing helpers' profiles as in our system, this issue is prevented since the profile histories would be transparent.
We would also allow an employer to provide feedback to the helper hired in our system, so future employers can have a more complete picture about that helper.
Employer feedback is not available in agency websites we have checked.

#### Online direct hiring platforms

Directly hiring domestic helpers is also available in Hong Kong, usually through online platforms like MamaHelpers [12] and HelperPlace [13].
Boundless choices of domestic helpers can be found not limited to one agency.
And the financial cost of employment is reduced by eliminating the agency commission.
Nonetheless, it is time-consuming to go through all the paperwork and procedures.

<!-- Pros: immense freedom of choices, lower cost

Cons: time-consuming (~1st pros)

Example: MamaHelper, HelperPlace

#### Blockchain-based platforms in other industries

Although not focused on domestic helpers, there are blockchain-based platforms built for other industries, such as Guardtime's wine authentication [14] and RMIT's land management systems [15].
Such platforms utilised blockchain's advantage to prevent superficial information since all data appended to blockchain are traceable.
Further applications on blockchain come from Estonia where most public services have built with a secure digital infrastructure [16].
However, the high cost of verification slows down the extensile uses of blockchain technology.

<!-- Pros: anti-tamper

Cons:
- high cost to verify
- Wine Authentication by Guardtime
