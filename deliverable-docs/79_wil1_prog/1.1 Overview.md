## 1.1 Overview

Hiring domestic helpers is a significant demand for Hong Kong families.
Some Hongkongers do not have the skill, energy or time to handle housework and thus want to outsource it to others.
In 2001, an enquiry showed that 10.1% of the Hong Kong households hired domestic helpers, and for the households that hired domestic helper, 12.1% of them hired local domestic helpers while 87.9% of them hired foreign domestic helpers.
In Hong Kong, common tasks for domestic helpers included "cleaning and tidying up the household", "purchasing and cooking food", "taking care of children" and "washing/ironing clothes" [1].

Foreign domestic helpers make up 5% of the Hong Kong population [2], [3].
In 2018, among the foreign domestic helpers, the majority of them are from the Philippines and Indonesia, comprising 54.6% and 43.0% of the total respectively.
0.6% of the foreign domestic helpers are from Thailand [3].
Foreign domestic helpers have been allowed to work in Hong Kong since the 1970s as the Hong Kong females were mobilized to enter the workforce [4] partly due to their increased education levels and changed social perceptions [5].
Since then, the number of foreign domestic helpers working in Hong Kong is ever-increasing.
From 2008 to 2018, the number increases from 256,597 to 386,075, with a rate of about 13,000 per year.
It was estimated that by 2048, 600,000 domestic helpers are needed [6].

The integrity of domestic helpers is an important issue.
From time to time, offences of domestic helpers, especially foreign domestic helpers are brought to public attention [7], [8], [9], [10].
Incidents like the Cambridge Nursing Home incident, where elderly residents were abused by being stripped naked on a balcony [11], reveal that some caretakers are not qualified.
It was reported that the number of convictions for offences involving foreign domestic helpers between 2004 and 2006 remained at around 800 per year [12].
These show that more generic misbehaviour of domestic helpers can be a commonplace.

The integrity of domestic helper agencies is also concerned.
There is a risk that agencies collude with domestic helpers to edit their profiles and remove negative histories so that they look more attractive to employers.
Agencies benefit in this case by getting more business and thus earning more commissions.

To tackle the aforementioned integrity issues from domestic helpers and agencies, a system Helper-Linker is proposed.
It offers a solution for employers to directly contact (link) domestic helpers in the job market without the need to seek assistance from agencies.
The system is also an integrated framework for domestic helpers to present their personal information to employers.
Each employer can provide feedback to the domestic helper hired that can be bound to personal information of the domestic helper.
Misbehaviour of domestic helpers can be revealed in this way as a warning sign to future employers.

The system utilizes blockchain and database technology to store the information of domestic helpers.
Utilizing blockchain can help to eliminate the issue of agencies tampering with domestic helper profiles.
This is because blockchain is an append-only ledger (which can be regarded as a kind of "linked" list).
Once a record enters a blockchain, it cannot be removed given that attackers' computation power does not dominate the system.
Thus, blockchain provides immutability needed.

To best of our knowledge, there is no such blockchain platform designed for domestic helpers and employers in Hong Kong.
Implementing the system can help to fill this gap so that the integrity issues can be largely solved.
