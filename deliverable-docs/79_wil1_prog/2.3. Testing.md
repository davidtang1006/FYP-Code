## 2.3. Testing

### 2.3.1. Purpose of Testing

We are going to build a reliable data storage application, so we need to ensure that it is free of bugs.
During the development phase, continuous integration [1] has been applied in our collaboration, so we test the program comprehensively every step we go further.
This helps us to ensure the validity of the system at any time.

### 2.3.2. Testing the database

To test the database, we will test the availability of multiple databases in our network.
To do this, we are going to write query test cases to test and record the result of each database.
Invalid results can be traced by reviewing the execution time of the record.
Apart from debugging, this may also help us to predict further maintenance issues.

### 2.3.3. Testing the blockchain system

To test the blockchain system, we will test the validity as well as the efficiency of blockchain operations.
The validity tests consist of two parts: one checks if our primitive function validate() is accurate when it is requested, and the other checks if all other functions requested pass the validate() test to meet the definition of a blockchain.
On the other hand, the efficiency of each blockchain will also be traced so we can evaluate the most balanced algorithm for hashing in terms of expense and outcome.
Expense means the required CPU power to be spent on appending blocks and the outcome means the level of immutability of the final blockchain.
In our situation, a low expense and high level of outcome is regarded as "good".

### 2.3.4. Testing the user interface

To test the user interface, we will invite agencies, training schools, helpers and employers to rate our application via an online survey.
The survey will consist of three parts: the satisfaction of functionality, the availability of language choices and satisfaction with the user experience.
These are essential elements that are built up gradually, so it will be tested when our mock-up application and final product are ready.

### 2.3.5. Testing the integration of modules

To test the integration of our frontend layer, backend layer and database layer, we will apply continuous integration testing by writing test programs for commitment.
This will enable us to have a concrete division of work so that we can trust the latest developed version of layers out of our individual tasks.
Therefore, we are able to develop separately with the vision of the whole system so as to establish connection within the system.
