Title: A Blockchain Database Application for Connecting Domestic Helpers and Hong Kong Employers

Abstract:\
Since the introduction of blockchain with Bitcoin's white paper in 2008, people have been scouting for different applications of blockchain.
However, much potential is yet to be discovered.
Blockchain mainly provides three core featuresâ€”decentralization, transparency, and immutability.

In this project, we explored the possibility of building a platform for connecting domestic helpers and Hong Kong employers, backed by a blockchain database.
The value we introduced is the theoretical resistance to anyone who would like to dishonestly tamper the records in the database, including domestic helpers, employers themselves or agencies.
Other than this, we also focused on building a user-friendly application with reference to the existing platforms in this project.
