## 1.3. Literature Survey

Our project is enlightened by local domestic helper agencies, online direct hiring platforms, and by blockchain-based platforms in other industries.

### 1.3.1. Local Domestic Helper Agencies

The vast majority of employers prefer to find agencies when they need a domestic helper.
Generally, agencies like Smart Living [23] and Lotus Employment Agency [24] provide assistance to select helpers and complete required documents.
Having lots of experience, they save employers a lot of time and effort.
However, convenience is not the only concern of most employers.
They are also concerned about fees and finding competent helpers.
Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for some agencies to overcharge employers and/or domestic helpers so as to gain greater profit.
In addition, due to competition among agencies, it is also not uncommon for agencies to provide false or misleading information about helpers' background or qualifications.
Furthermore, it is not uncommon for agencies to hide the negative aspects of certain employers, like high turnover of helpers, previous labour or criminal cases, large families to take care of or occupations in which their days of work are not Sundays.

### 1.3.2. Online Direct Hiring Platforms

Directly hiring domestic helpers is also available in Hong Kong, usually through online platforms like MamaHelpers [25] and HelperPlace [26].
Boundless choices of domestic helpers can be found that are not limited to one agency.
And the financial cost of employment is reduced by eliminating the agency commission.
Nonetheless, it is time-consuming to go through all the paperwork and procedures.

### 1.3.3. Blockchain-based Platforms in Other Industries

Although not focused on domestic helpers, there are blockchain-based platforms built for other industries, such as Guardtime's wine authentication [27] and RMIT's land management systems [28].
Such platforms utilise blockchain's advantage of preventing the loss or changing of information, since all data appended to a blockchain is traceable.
Further applications on blockchain come from Estonia, where most public services are built with a secure digital infrastructure [29].
However, the high cost of verification slows down the extensile uses of blockchain technology.
