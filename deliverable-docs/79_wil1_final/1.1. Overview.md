## 1.1. Overview

Hiring domestic helpers is a significant demand for Hong Kong families.
Some Hongkongers do not have the skill, energy or time to handle housework and thus want to outsource it to others.
In 2001, an enquiry showed that 10.1% of the Hong Kong households hired domestic helpers, and for the households that hired domestic helpers, 12.1% of them hired local domestic helpers, while 87.9% of them hired foreign domestic helpers.
In Hong Kong, common tasks for domestic helpers included "cleaning and tidying up the household", "purchasing and cooking food", "taking care of children" and "washing/ironing clothes" [1].

In 2019, foreign domestic helpers made up 5% of the Hong Kong population [2], [3].
In 2018, among the foreign domestic helpers, the majority of them were from the Philippines and Indonesia, comprising 54.6% and 43.0% of the total, respectively.
0.6% of the foreign domestic helpers were from Thailand [3].
Foreign domestic helpers have been allowed to work in Hong Kong since the 1970s as the Hong Kong females were mobilized to enter the workforce [4] partly due to their increased education levels and changed social perceptions [5].
Since then, the number of foreign domestic helpers working in Hong Kong has been ever increasing.
From 2008 to 2018, the number increased from 256,597 to 386,075, with a rate of increase of about 13,000 per year.
It was estimated that by 2048, 600,000 domestic helpers will be needed [6].

The integrity of domestic helpers and employers is an important issue.
From time to time, offences of domestic helpers, especially foreign domestic helpers, are brought to public attention [7], [8], [9], [10].
Incidents like the Cambridge Nursing Home incident, where elderly residents were abused by being stripped naked on a balcony [11], reveal that some caretakers are not qualified.
It was reported that the number of convictions for offences involving foreign domestic helpers between 2004 and 2006 was around 800 per year [12].
These show that more generic misbehaviour of domestic helpers can be a commonplace.
Furthermore, it is also known that employers can misbehave by failing to fulfil their contractual obligations or by physically or sexually assaulting their helpers [13], [14], [15], [16].

The integrity of domestic helper agencies is also concerned.
There is a risk that agencies collude with domestic helpers to edit their profiles and remove negative histories so that they look more attractive to employers.
Agencies benefit in this case by getting more business and thus earning more commissions.

To tackle the aforementioned integrity issues from domestic helpers, employers and agencies, an application named Helper-Linker (or more accurately, Helper–Employer Linker) is proposed in this project.
It offers a solution for employers to directly contact (link) domestic helpers in the job market without the need to seek assistance from agencies.
The application is also an integrated framework for domestic helpers to present their personal information to employers, while employers can present their information in job descriptions for helpers.
In addition, each employer can provide feedback about the domestic helpers he/she has hired that can be bound to personal information of the domestic helpers, so that misbehaviour of domestic helpers can be revealed in this way as a warning sign to future employers.
Likewise, each domestic helper can provide feedback about their employers in the same way, so that the misbehaviour of employers can also be revealed.

The application utilizes blockchain and database technology to store the information of domestic helpers and employers.
Utilizing blockchain can help to eliminate the issue of agencies tampering with domestic helper profiles, because blockchain is an append-only ledger (which can be regarded as a kind of "linked" list or a transactional database).
Once a record enters a blockchain, it cannot be removed given that attackers' computation power does not dominate the system.
Thus, blockchain provides immutability needed.
(See Appendix B: Blockchain Basics<!-- (!) -->.)

The ultimate goal of the project is to improve the trustworthiness of both helpers and employers, as both will understand that they will be held accountable for their actions, so both will try hard to behave properly.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no such blockchain platform designed for domestic helpers and employers in Hong Kong, so implementing this application can help to fill this gap so that the integrity issues can be largely solved.
