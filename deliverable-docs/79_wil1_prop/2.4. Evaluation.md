## 2.4. Evaluation

One of our purpose of developing the system is to gain trust between domestic helper and employer.
However, it could be a progressive milestone that requires a long period of time to observe and improve because the number of users could be accumulative as time goes by.
Therefore, we list out some quantitative indicators that helps us to foresee the effectiveness:
1. Does the application attract helpers and employers with its service as well as showing the searching result of the desired one?
2. Does the maximum capacity of the system satisfactory for peak time? How would the delaying process influence the system?
3. Is the system easy to deploy by companies? If not, which part in frontend, backend and database is the bottleneck?
4. Is there any risk of data leaks? Would our application gain trust from domestic helpers looking forward for a stable job?
5. What is the feedback from old customers or business insiders in current domestic helper agent industry?

On the aspect of commercialization, our project is more than development, but also data analysis, marketing and contributing to the society.
These focus points would be our first steps to the present world.
