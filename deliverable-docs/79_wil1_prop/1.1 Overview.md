## 1.1 Overview

There is a significant demand for Hong Kong families to hire domestic helpers.
Some Hongkongers do not have the skill, energy or time to handle housework and thus want to outsource it to others.
In 2001, an enquiry showed that 10.1% of the Hong Kong households hired domestic helpers, and for the households that hired domestic helper, 12.1% of them hired local domestic helpers while 87.9% of them hired foreign domestic helpers.
Common tasks for domestic helpers include "cleaning and tidying up the household", "purchasing and cooking food", "taking care of children" and "washing/ironing clothes" [1].

Foreign domestic helpers make up 5% of the Hong Kong population [2], [3].
In 2018, among the foreign domestic helpers, the majority of them are from the Philippines and Indonesia, comprising 54.6% and 43.0% of the total respectively.
0.6% of the foreign domestic helpers are from Thailand [3].
Foreign domestic helpers have been allowed to work in Hong Kong since the 1970's as the Hong Kong females were mobilised to enter the workforce [4].
Since then, the number of foreign domestic helpers working in Hong Kong is ever-increasing.
From 2008 to 2018, the number increases from  256,597 to 386,075, with a rate of about 13,000 per year.
It is estimated that by 2048, 600,000 domestic helpers are needed [5].

<!-- Add a topic sentence here. -->
From time to time, offences of domestic helpers, especially foreign domestic helpers are brought to the public attention [6], [7], [8], [9].
Incidents like the Cambridge Nursing Home incident, where elderly residents were abused by being stripped naked on a balcony [10], reveals that some caretakers not being qualified is an alerting problem.
Between 2004 and 2006, it is reported that the number of convictions for offences involving foreign domestic helper kept at around 800 per year [11].
Among the varied types of convictions for offences, there are several crimes that would bring financial losses to their employers, including "theft", "illegal working" and "wounding and aggravated assault".

These potentially show that the misbehaviour of domestic helpers is likely to be a commonplace.
There is also a risk that domestic helper agencies collude with domestic helpers to edit their portfolios and remove negative histories so that they look more attractive to the employers.
Agencies benefit in this case by getting more business and thus earning more commissions.

A system Helper-Linker (?) will be proposed to offer a solution for the employers to directly contact (link) domestic helpers in the job market without the need to seek assistance from agencies.
The system is also an integrated framework for domestic helpers to present their personal information to the employers.
In addition, each employer can provide feedbacks to the domestic helper hired that can be bound to personal information of the domestic helper.
Misbehaviour of domestic helpers can be revealed in this way as a warning sign to future employers.

The system will utilise blockchain and database technology to store the information of domestic helpers.
Utilising blockchain can help to cope with the issue of agencies tampering with domestic helper portfolios.
This is because blockchain is an append-only ledger (which can be regarded as a kind of "linked" list).
It allows auditability and traceability [12].

To best of our knowledge<!-- David have attempted the search terms "hong kong employment blockchain" and "hong kong domestic helper blockchain" and found no relevant results -->, there is no such blockchain platform designed for domestic helpers and employers in Hong Kong.
Implementing the system can help to fill this gap.
