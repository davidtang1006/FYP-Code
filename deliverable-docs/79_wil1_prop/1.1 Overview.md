## 1.1 Overview

There is a significant demand for Hong Kong families to hire domestic helpers.
Some Hongkongers do not have the skill, energy or time to handle housework and thus want to outsource it to others.
In 2001, an enquiry showed that 10.1% of the households hired domestic helpers, and for the households that hired domestic helper, 12.1% of them hired local domestic helpers while 87.9% of them hired foreign domestic helpers.
Common tasks for domestic helpers include "cleaning and tidying up the household", "purchasing and cooking food", "taking care of children" and "washing/ironing clothes" [1].

Foreign domestic helpers make up 5% of Hong Kong population [2][3].
In 2018, among the foreign domestic helpers, the majority of them are from Philippines and Indonesia, comprising 54.6% and 43.0% of the total respectively.
0.6% of the foreign domestic helpers are from Thailand [3].
Foreign domestic helpers have been allowed to work in Hong Kong since 1970's as the Hong Kong females were mobilised to enter the workforce [4].
Since then, the number of foreign domestic helpers working in Hong Kong is ever-increasing.
From 2008 to 2018, the number increases from  256597 to 386075, with a rate of about 13000 per year.
It is estimated that by 2048, 600000 domestic helpers are needed [5].

A system will be proposed to offer a solution for the employers to directly contact domestic helpers in the job market without the need to seek assistance to agencies (?).
The system is also an integrated framework for domestic helpers to...
To best of our knowledge, there is no such platform designed for domestic helpers and employers in Hong Kong.

Blockchain can help to cope with the issue of agencies tampering with domestic helper portfolios.
