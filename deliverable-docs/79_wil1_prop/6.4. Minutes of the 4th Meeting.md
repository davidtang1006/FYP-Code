1. Approval of minutes

The minutes of the last meeting were approved without amendment.

2. Discussion

2.1. David motivated others to read some relevant material and introduced some slides from the workshop "1st HKUST-Xunlei Joint Lab Workshop: Blockchain Technology and its Applications" he attended on 17/6/2019, which may be useful.
Linda suggested converting the recordings from the workshop into texts.
While David would like to assign some reading material, Linda and Ting preferred to find reading material on their own.
In the end, the group asked David to **work on the proposal with the slides from the workshop.**

2.2. Follow-up action: **literature survey** for everyone with topics not limited.

2.3. Learnt that the deadline of the proposal is 19/9/2019.

2.4. David prepared a proposal template.
Linda suggested three areas for the group to work on: background, requirement and implementation.

2.5. Linda furthered the discussion by asking if anyone has experience with the front end.
No one has such experience.
Therefore, we discussed web features that can be provided.
And we further analysed the back-end service and the server.
Implementing a centralized server is suggested by Ting and Linda.
**The discussion is still on the table.**

2.6. Follow-up action: **Ask Wilfred via an email** for graduate students' contact information for background information about domestic helpers and existing datasets.

3. Suggested tasks to do

3.1. We are going to write **individual literature surveys** and **contribute to the proposal** according to the roles shown in the table of the division of work in point 3.3 below.

3.2. Literature survey is going to be about any topics of blockchain database, existing domestic helper agents and agent application.
We should be able to summarise the reason for choosing to develop a blockchain application for domestic helpers.
