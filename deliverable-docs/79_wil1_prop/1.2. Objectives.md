## 1.2. Objectives

Blockchain is not a new design.
It first appeared in 1991 [1].
However, with the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, which showed how blockchain can be used to build a new form of electronic cash system, which waives the requirement of a financial institution (the central authority) [2], people started to realise the usefulness of the design of blockchain.
Since then, the interest in blockchain expanded and it has just peaked in early 2018 [3].
We will utilise this relatively popular design in our proposed system to provide a tamper-free platform for employers to contact with domestic helpers.

A system to cope with the requirement will be composed of:
- Front end (this part implements a user-friendly interface for the end users, including employers and domestic helpers)
- Back end (which includes administration of database, implementation of blockchain, etc.) (?)

A serious challenge of this project is that it touches real-world problems.
The project should take the complexity of a person into consideration.
How should contracts be handled?
What should be our privacy policy?
With limited time to develop the system, it may not be in full compliance with the law.
We should be prepared to make adjustments to better comply with the law.
