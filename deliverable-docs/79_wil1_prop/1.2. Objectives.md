## 1.2. Objectives

Blockchain is not a new design.
It first appeared in 1991 [1].
However, with the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008 [2], which showed how blockchain can be used to build a new form of electronic cash system, which waives the requirement of a financial institution (the central authority), people start to realise the potential of the design of blockchain.
Since then, the interest in blockchain expanded and peaked in early 2018 [3].

The goal of this project is to learn from the existing platforms which provide database for the job seekers and employers, for example, Interactive Employer Service of the Labour Department [4], Smart Living [5], HelperGo [6], Lotus Employment Agency [7], MaMaHelpers [8] and build a prototype system to enable employers to find suitable domestic helpers.
In addition, we will incorporate blockchain into the system to eliminate the need for domestic helper agencies (?) and to provide tamper-free records of domestic helpers.
