### 2.1.4. Domestic Helper Use Case Specification

The domestic helper use case specification can be viewed as the key to the system.
It is supplied below.
We will continue to refine it and work out the detailed specifications for other actors.

#### Brief description

The use case describes how a domestic helper manages the information posted in the system.

#### Use case diagram

```
Domestic helper (actor) â†’ Manage the information posted in the system

#### Basic flow

1. The use case begins when a domestic helper decides to fill in his/her information for employment.

   4. Date of birth
   5. Languages

   13.  Certificate (it can be verified by third-party)
   14.  Comments, ratings of multiple dimensions together with the employment period from previous employers (if there are any) which is read-only (how to ensure that this is not fabricated can be a problem)

3. The domestic helper submits the form.

**{End filling the form}**

4. The use case ends.

##### Modifying the form
