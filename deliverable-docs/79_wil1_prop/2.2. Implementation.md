## 2.2. Implementation

<!-- OAuth 2.0, language of back end, P2P technology will be mentioned here (David). -->

Back end Language:
A back end layer is required for communication between front end layer and database layer, and therefore a back end language is considered important in our project. Here are two common languages implemented in back end, C++ and Java.

C++:
C++ is a general-purpose language with both high-level and low-level features. 
It is the more advanced version of C, which was started to develop in 1979 [1]. 
C++ does not only support procedural programming like what C does, but also additionally allows object-oriented programming [2]. 
For the compilation process, source code written in C++ is first translated into object code, and then machine code. 

Since different operating systems obtain different machine code for the same program and recompilation is required when the platform is changed, C++ is described as platform-dependent [3]. 
C++ provides a lot of useful features, like generic programming, multiple inheritance and operator overloading, which makes it more flexible. 
C++ allows users to access memory by utilizing pointer, and thus the possibility of memory leakage is higher if the pointer is not properly handled [4]. 

Communication between C++ interface and database servers can only be allowed through connectors. 
Generally, numerous server companies provide their specific C++ driver for connection, for example, MongoDB C++ driver [5] and MySQL Connector/C++ [6]. 
For SQL server, either ODBC (Open DataBase Connectivity) or OLE DB (Object Linking and Embedding database) helps with connection. 
Both of them are universal APIs while the former one is claimed to be simpler and much faster than the latter one [7].   

Java:
Java is a high-level programming language invented in 1991 [8]. 
Its compilation method differs from the traditional ones’ by compiling the program to a bytecode, instead of compiling it to machine code or interpreting it from source code at program runtime. 
The bytecode obtained in the former one is then run by Java Virtual Machine (JVM) [9] .

With the above feature, Java is platform-independent, implying that no recompilation is needed even the program is implemented in various platforms. 
Java is also object-oriented with restricted pointer, whose memory is mainly controlled by the system, and therefore has a lower opportunity to have memory leakage compared to C++ [10]. 

Java supports the vast majority of database servers, with its Java DataBase Connectivity (JDBC), like MongoDB [11], MySQL [12] and SQL server [13]. 
Being a generic universal API, JDBC has the advantage of high portability and the ability of running the program in different machines. 


Encryption: 
The following are the encryption approaches commonly implemented in blockchain, SHA-256 and X11.

SHA-256:
SHA-256, which stands for Secure Hashing Algorithms, is one of the most popular hashing methods nowadays. 
It was invented by National Security Agency (NSA) in 2001, as an improvement of SHA-1. It is implemented by dividing the data message into N blocks with 512 bits each and every block carries 15 32-bit input blocks. 
For each 512-bit block, a message schedule W is created by combining the required block and three other shuffled blocks obtained by formulas. 
Through some complicated calculations, a new hash value will be produced [1].

This algorithm is commonly implemented in various blockchain systems, such as Bitcoin [2], with the reasons below. 
The maximum amount of data messages being able to be transformed is 2⁶⁴ bit, while each of them is fixed as 256 bits, as the method’s name states [3]. With a larger hashing length, the security level would be improved. 
Furthermore, the method is currently resistant to hash collision attack with a very low collision rate [4]. 
No identical hashes will be produced and this, therefore, prevents the hackers from substituting one hashed value for another and increases their difficulty to gain the data. 

However, the structure and mathematical operations of SHA-256 are similar to those of the previous version SHA-1, which was cracked successfully in 2017. 
As a result, it is believed that SHA-256 might be compromised in the upcoming future [5].

X11:
X11 is a newer hashing algorithm compared to the former, which was created by Dash core developer in 2004. 
It applies 11 individual hashing algorithms, for example, BLAKE, BLUE MIDNIGHT WISH (BMW), Grøstl, JH, Keccak, Skein, Luffa, CubeHash, SHAvite-3, SIMD, ECHO, for the proof-of-work [6]. 
According to the official website, it is an improved version of another chained-hashing approach called Quark. 
The former increases the amount of hashes in the hope of building a more complex and deeper algorithm. Besides, the rounds of hashes are no longer randomly selected, instead, they are fixed [7].

With the huge number of various rounds of hashes, it can provide a safer and more sophisticated hashing algorithm. 
Compared to SHA-256, which is single-hash, it is more protective against Single Point Of Failure (SPOF), an example of security dangers. 
This implies that the entire system is able to keep functioning until the 11 hashes are cracked at the same time. 
If one of the hashes is determined as unreliable, warning will be alerted and that hash can be replaced by other more secure hash later on. 
Therefore, both the reliability and security level of X11 are higher than those of SHA-256.

Despite of more secure, due to the complicated calculation of 11 hashing algorithms, the memory requirement becomes one of the concerns of X11 [8]. 
Dealing with the large amount of algorithm requires a lot of storage and ram in the system.
