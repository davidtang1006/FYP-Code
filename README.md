# Final Year Project Code

This repository mainly implements some of the core back end features for our application.
Due to the recent events (e.g. the lockdown because of the virus), we find it challenging to integrate different components together as communications are restricted.
Major missing pieces are HTTP request handling and multi-node setup, but the framework should be stable.
Regarding the instructions to evaluate the code, please refer to [the development logs](./development-logs/).
Specifically, [this log](<./development-logs/20200213~20200217 Retrieving essential information from the database to log in and after the login.md>) can be a good starting point.
